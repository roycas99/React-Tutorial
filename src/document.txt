#13 useffect
it fire every  renders. good for data fetch. inside this hook we can access state component but do not do any change in state .it manages side-effect in functional react component.
if func component makes calculations that don't target the output value, then these calculations are named side-effects.
Examples of side-effects are fetch requests, manipulating DOM directly, using timer functions like setTimeout(), and more.
Put your side-effect logic into the callback function, then use the dependencies argument to control when you want the side-effect to run. 
qThat's the sole purpose of useEffect().
